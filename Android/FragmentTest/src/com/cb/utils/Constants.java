			"Monday (Listeni/ˈmʌndeɪ/ or /ˈmʌndi/) is the day of the week between Sunday and Tuesday. According to the traditional Christian, Islamic and Hebrew calendars, it is the second day of the week. But according to international standard ISO 8601 it is the first day of the week. The name of Monday is derived from Old English Mōnandæg and Middle English Monenday, which means \"moon day\".",
			"Tuesday (Listeni/ˈtjuːzdeɪ/, /ˈtjuːzdi/, /ˈtuːzdeɪ/ or /ˈtuːzdi/) is a day of the week occurring after Monday and before Wednesday. According to some commonly used calendars (esp. in the US), it is the third day of the week, but according to international standard ISO 8601, it is the second day of the week. The English name is derived from Old English Tiwesdæg and Middle English Tewesday, meaning \"Tīw's Day\", the day of Tiw or Týr, the god of single combat, victory and heroic glory in Norse mythology. Tiw was equated with Mars in the interpretatio romana, and the name of the day is a translation of Latin dies Martis.", 
			"Wednesday (Listeni/ˈwɛdənzdeɪ/, Listeni/ˈwɛnzdeɪ/[1] or /ˈwɛnzdi/[2]) is the day of the week between Tuesday and Thursday. According to international standard ISO 8601 adopted in most western countries it is the third day of the week. In countries that use the Sunday-first convention Wednesday is defined as the fourth day of the week. It is the fourth day of the week in the Judeo-Christian calendar as well, and was defined so in the ancient Mesopotamian and biblical calendars. The name is derived from Old English Wōdnesdæg and Middle English Wednesdei, \"day of Wodanaz\", ultimately a calque of dies Mercurii \"day of Mercury\"." +
			"Wednesday is in the middle of the common Western five-day workweek that starts on Monday and finishes on Friday." };
